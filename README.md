# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 


This is a text based Hangman Game built as a project for the AICore course. I have used VScode, python, git, github and terminal. within python i have used the module random so the word to guees is not always the same, or so that the order of the words is not predicatable.
