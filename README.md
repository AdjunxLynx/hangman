# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 


This is a text based Hangman Game built as a project for the AICore course. I have used VScode, python, git, github and terminal. within python i have used the module random so the word to guees is not always the same, or so that the order of the words is not predicatable.

the terminal cmds i have used for this is your basic ``` git add .``` ```git commit -m "" ``` and ```git push ``` so i can have a secure and good version control locally and online.


i have now introduced functions into my code and copied the existing code i had into them. this allows me to keep my variables seperate and not accidently use the incorrect variables later on in my code. automatically calls the functions when the code is run.
